The Sound of Comics - A musical Web App
===================

How can you interact with your audience through a Comic Figure?
With "The Sound of Comics", Rahel Comic Girl acts like a Live Musician:

You press "Clap" on your midi Keyboard, you see and hear Rahel Comic Girl do it on screen!
You press "OOH", Rahel Comic Girls sings it!
You press "Bass Drum", Rahel Comic Girl moves hear foot.

Rahel Comic Girl was created by Musician Rahel Kraska to accompany her on Stage.
Live musicians are so expensive...and often late:)
While first performing within videos, Rahel Comic Girl is getting interactive now.
